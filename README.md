# Google Books

A project that uses the Google Books API to allow users to search through Google Books' database
and receive the information they want.

## Purpose

This program implements the Google Books API so users can access its database. Users can type in
a query and the API will return and display 5 results, which includes the book's author, title, and publishing company,
relating to the user's search. Among the displayed books, users can choose which of them to save in
a local "Reading List" that they can view once they decided to stop searching for more books.
